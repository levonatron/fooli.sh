# fooli.sh

a shell script for slow writing in fast systems  
a slow system for writing against fast scripts  
a shell script for sea shells eating rot bots  
a super fast way of doing nothing  
a slow-fa$t vomit on the keengâ€™s bed

**fooli.sh** is a command-line memory tool designed for long-form thinking in environments built for blood.

It runs from the shell, keeps your writing local, and never syncs to the cloud.  
Instead of prompts, it rotates fragments from your past entries, helping you remember what you were becoming.  
Each entry is timestamped, archived, and contributes to a slow-growing novel â€” stored as a series of fragments, not metrics.
